## Technical Knowledge and Experience

1.  **“Describe a complex React component you’ve built that you’re particularly proud of. What challenges did you face during its development, and how did you address them?”**
    * **Instructions:** Pick a real example (e.g., a reusable data grid, complex form, or a drag-and-drop UI). Highlight technical challenges (performance, state management, reusability). Explain how you solved them (memoization, context, custom hooks).

2.  **“How do you approach state management in large React applications? Please discuss your experience with Redux, Context API, and other state management solutions, highlighting the scenarios where you’d choose one over another.”**
    * **Instructions:** Compare Redux, Context API, Zustand, Recoil, etc. Provide examples of when you used each. Discuss trade-offs (boilerplate vs. simplicity, scalability).

3.  **“TypeScript introduces type safety to JavaScript. Could you walk me through a situation where TypeScript helped you prevent a significant bug or improved your development workflow?”**
    * **Instructions:** Give a concrete example (e.g., catching an undefined prop, enforcing API contracts). Explain how it improved maintainability or prevented bugs.

4.  **“Explain your approach to optimizing performance in a React application. What metrics do you prioritize, and what techniques have you implemented successfully?”**
    * **Instructions:** Mention techniques like memoization, virtualization, lazy loading, code splitting, `useCallback`, `useMemo`. Discuss tools (React DevTools, Lighthouse, Chrome Performance tab).

5.  **“How do you handle complex asynchronous operations in a frontend application? Please share specific patterns or libraries you’ve used and their impact on your codebase.”**
    * **Instructions:** Mention solutions like React Query, Redux Toolkit with Thunks, Promises, async/await. Explain how you prevent race conditions, handle errors, and manage loading states.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Approach

6.  **“Tell me about a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in your frontend development career. How did you diagnose it, what solution did you implement, and what did you learn from the experience?”**
    * **Instructions:** Describe the issue, debugging process (logs, breakpoints, network requests), and how you fixed it.

7.  **“How would you approach refactoring a large, legacy codebase with minimal documentation? What strategies would you employ to ensure stability while modernizing the application?”**
    * **Instructions:** Gradual refactoring, writing tests, introducing TypeScript, feature flags.

8.  **“Describe your experience implementing accessibility features in web applications. What specific challenges have you faced in making applications WCAG compliant?”**
    * **Instructions:** Talk about WCAG guidelines, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, color contrast issues. Mention how you tested (axe DevTools, Lighthouse, screen readers).

9.  **“Walk me through your process for debugging a complex frontend issue reported by customers but difficult to reproduce in development environments.”**
    * **Instructions:** Mention strategies like logs, feature flags, remote debugging, reproducing on different networks/devices.

10. **“What strategies do you employ to ensure cross-browser compatibility in your applications? How do you balance modern features with broader support?”**
    * **Instructions:** Discuss CSS fallbacks, polyfills, caniuse.com, testing in different browsers. Explain trade-offs between modern features and backward compatibility.

## Collaboration and Communication

11. **“Describe a situation where you had a technical disagreement with a team member about an architectural decision. How did you resolve it, and what was the outcome?”**
    * **Instructions:** Discuss data-driven decision-making, proof of concept, compromise. Example: Debating Redux vs. Context for state management.

12. **“How do you approach code reviews? What specific aspects do you focus on when reviewing others’ code, and how do you ensure your feedback is constructive?”**
    * **Instructions:** Mention readability, maintainability, security, performance. Explain how you give feedback constructively (e.g., suggesting changes, not just pointing out mistakes).

13. **“Tell me about your experience working with backend developers. How do you approach API design collaborations, and how do you handle situations where the API doesn’t meet frontend requirements?”**
    * **Instructions:** API design collaboration, handling inefficient APIs, suggesting improvements like pagination or batching requests.

14. **“How do you balance technical debt with delivery deadlines? Can you share an example where you had to make this tradeoff and explain your reasoning?”**
    * **Instructions:** Example: Choosing to write tests later but ensuring core functionality is solid.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

15. **“What recent frontend technology or pattern has excited you the most? How have you incorporated it into your work or personal projects?”**
    * **Instructions:** Pick something recent (React Server Components, AI in UI, WebAssembly). Explain how you’ve applied it.

16. **“Describe how you stay current with the rapidly evolving frontend ecosystem. What resources do you rely on, and how do you evaluate whether a new technology is worth adopting?”**
    * **Instructions:** Mention resources (MDN, Smashing Magazine, podcasts, conferences).

17. **“What area of frontend development do you feel you still need to improve in? How are you addressing this gap in your knowledge or skills?”**
    * **Instructions:** Be honest, show a growth mindset (e.g., "I’m improving my WebGL skills by building small projects").
